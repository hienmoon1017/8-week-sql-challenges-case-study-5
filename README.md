### 1. Data Cleansing Steps

 ```sql
-- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
ALTER TABLE data_mart.weekly_sales
ADD COLUMN clean_week_date date;

UPDATE data_mart.weekly_sales
SET clean_week_date = to_date(week_date,'DD-MM-YY');

-- Add a week_number, month_number, calendar_year
ALTER TABLE data_mart.weekly_sales
ADD COLUMN week_number integer,
ADD COLUMN month_number integer,
ADD COLUMN calendar_year integer;

UPDATE data_mart.weekly_sales
SET week_number = extract(week from clean_week_date) 
,month_number = extract(month from clean_week_date)
,calendar_year = extract (year from clean_week_date);

-- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column
ALTER TABLE data_mart.weekly_sales
ADD COLUMN age_band varchar;

UPDATE data_mart.weekly_sales
SET age_band = case when right(segment,1) = '1' then 'Young Adults'
					when right(segment,1) = '2' then 'Middle Aged'
					when right(segment,1) = '3' or right(segment,1) = '4' then 'Retirees'
					else 'unknown'
					end;

-- Add a new demographic
ALTER TABLE data_mart.weekly_sales
ADD COLUMN demographic varchar;

UPDATE data_mart.weekly_sales
SET demographic = case when left(segment,1) = 'C' then 'Couples'
						when left(segment,1) = 'F' then 'Family'
						else 'unknown'
						end;

-- Add new avg_transaction
ALTER TABLE data_mart.weekly_sales
ADD COLUMN avg_transaction float;

UPDATE data_mart.weekly_sales
SET avg_transaction = round(sales / transactions,2);
```
### 2. Data Exploration
#### 2.1 What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
```sql
SELECT distinct clean_week_date
,to_char(clean_week_date,'Day') as day_of_week
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
ORDER BY 1;
```

_Result:_

#### 2.2 What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

```sql
WITH all_weeks as
(
	SELECT generate_series(1,52) as week_number

SELECT aw.week_number
FROM all_weeks aw
LEFT JOIN data_mart.weekly_sales ws on ws.week_number = aw.week_number
WHERE ws.week_number is null
ORDER BY 1;
```

ORDER BY 1,2;
```

_Result:_

#### 2.6 What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

```sql

	,sum(case when lower(platform) = 'retail' then sales else 0 end) as retail_sales
	,sum(case when lower(platform) = 'shopify' then sales else 0 end) as shopify_sales
	FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
	GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT month
,round(retail_sales *100 / nullif(retail_sales + shopify_sales,0),2) || '%' as percent_retail_sales
,round(shopify_sales *100/ nullif(retail_sales + shopify_sales,0),2) || '%' as percent_shopify_sales -- nullif to avoid dividing 0
FROM platform_metrics
ORDER BY 1;
```

_Result:_

	,sum(case when lower(demographic) = 'couples' then sales else 0 end) as couple_sales
	,sum(case when lower(demographic) = 'unknown' then sales else 0 end) as unknown_sales
	FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
	GROUP BY 1

SELECT calendar_year
,round(family_sales *100 / (family_sales + couple_sales + unknown_sales),2) || '%' as percent_family_sales
,round(couple_sales *100/ (family_sales + couple_sales + unknown_sales),2) || '%' as percent_couples_sales
,round(unknown_sales *100/ (family_sales + couple_sales + unknown_sales),2) || '%' as percent_unknown_sales

#### 2.9 Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```sql
SELECT calendar_year
,platform
,round(sum(sales)/sum(transactions),2) as avg_transaction
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
WHERE lower(platform) in ('retail', 'shopify')
GROUP BY 1,2

### 3. Before & After Analysis
_Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week_
#### 3.1 What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql
WITH sales_period as
(
	SELECT
	sum(case when clean_week_date between '2020-06-15'::date and '2020-06-15'::date + interval '4 weeks' then sales else 0 end) as sales_after
